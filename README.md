# R Subsetting Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in R programming related to subsetting data frames using logical conditions.  The bug arises from incorrectly using the assignment operator (`=`) instead of the equality operator (`==`) within the logical condition used for subsetting.

The `bug.r` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.r` provides the corrected version.

This is a frequent mistake for those transitioning to R from other languages, highlighting the importance of understanding R's specific syntax for logical operations within subsetting operations.
